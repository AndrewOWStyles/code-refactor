#Horiseon Code-refactor Assignment

## Description

The point of this project was to assess the ability of the learning developer by having them look through a html document
and CSS file and optimize the code within. The learning developer was to streamline the semantic html elements to allow greater
search function ability by any search engine as well as making sure that all HTML elements followed a logical structure. This was achieved by changing existing (div) elements into more useful elements such as (nav) or (figure) to allow someone reading the code a clearer understanding of the pages content and structure.
